# My past career

I was a professional ballet dancer with [Ballet West](https://www.balletwest.org/), [Zurich Ballet](https://www.opernhaus.ch/en/), [New Jersey Ballet](https://www.njballet.org/), and [Kaohsiung City Ballet](https://www.kcb.org.tw/). I have extensive knowledge of the culture, career paths, artistry, and athleticism involved in both classical ballet and contemporary dance. My artistic view is strongly influenced by [Igal Perry](https://www.peridance.com/facprofile.cfm?FID=1&name=Igal%20Perry%20_//%20Artistic%20Director), artistic director of [Peridance Center](https://www.peridance.com/). Some of my career highlights include

- Performed nearly every role in *The Nutcracker*.
    - Believe it or not, I was the Nutcracker, and [Nathan Chen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Chen) was my Fritz in Ballet West's production.
- Won the Capezio Award at the 2010 USA International Ballet Competition (USA), under the name Guixien Chu. 
- Got eliminated in the first round at the 2010 Varna International Ballet Competition. 
    - My friend [Avetik Karapetyan](https://www.youtube.com/@avcarvest) did great, though!
    - Roommate was [Brooklyn Mack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Mack).
- Bronze medalist at the 2008 World Ballet Competition in Orlando.
- Finalist at the 2007 Seoul International Dance Competition.
- Quarterfinalist at the 2004 Prix de Lausanne (inclined/raked stage â€” ouch!).
    - [Alex Wong](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3940692/) won the competition that year.
- Completed high school at [Taipei National University of the Arts](https://w3.tnua.edu.tw/) (yes, they have a high school!).
    - Many of my friends went on to dance at [Cloud Gate Theatre of Taiwan](https://www.cloudgate.org.tw/en/cg).

If you or your children are interested in ballet, perhaps I can take a look!
