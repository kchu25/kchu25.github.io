# My past career

I was a professional ballet dancer with [Ballet West](https://www.balletwest.org/) and [Zurich Ballet](https://www.opernhaus.ch/en/), awarded several prizes in international competitions. I have extensive knowledge of the culture, career paths, artistry, and athleticism involved in both classical ballet and contemporary dance. My artistic view is strongly influenced by [Igal Perry](https://www.peridance.com/facprofile.cfm?FID=1&name=Igal%20Perry%20_//%20Artistic%20Director), artistic director of [Peridance Center](https://www.peridance.com/).
