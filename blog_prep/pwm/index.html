This is a question I think about â€“ after all, why even bother characterize it if we do not intend to use it?</p> <p>One nice thing about it is that we can visualize it. E.g. the database JASPAR gives you a catalog of logos of transcription factor binding sites. The height of each letter in the logo reflects how conserved that nucleotide is at that position of the binding site.</p> <p>Is that it? Ah, the traditional use of PWMs is to use them to scan a long DNA or an RNA sequence, to identify the putative motifs. This can be done efficiently via methods like MOODS. The sequence can be long, e.g. entire genome, and it&#39;s impressive that MOODS can work easily in such setting.</p> <p>Ok, we now have visualization can do scannings. That... to be honest, doesn&#39;t sound super powerful. We identified the sites. So what? At least in the age of AI, people have more expectations; they want magical things. </p> <p>I&#39;d argue the view that viewing the PWMs as an end of themselves isn&#39;t appropriate. Its role is &quot;meta&quot;, and has always been that since its inception.</p> <p>If we think about the regulation happening in the cells, then binding sites &#40;or PWMs&#41; are words, and visualizing and searching for words in a sentence isn&#39;t that meaningful if we don&#39;t know what the sentence mean.</p> <div class=page-foot > Contact me by <a href="mailto:sc5502@cumc.columbia.edu">E-mail</a> | <a href="https://github.com/kchu25">Github</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kchu1/">Linkedin</a> <br> This work is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.
