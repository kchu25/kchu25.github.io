I am a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Washington University in St. Louis. My advisor is Gary Stormo. My research interest is developing computational methods for computational biology problems.

A central theme in my research is to consider what representation is suited for DNA sequences that give the most helpful information. Traditionally, there are k-mers, position-weight-matrices, parametric statistical models like HMMs, and, more recently, deep learning. I am currently interested in sparse representations, a framework that allows us to build techniques to answer challenging inference questions in regulatory genomics.

For example, these inference questions include:
- What are the DNA sequences' regulatory elements (e.g., motifs)?
- What key regulatory features in the DNA sequences give rise to the observed phenomenon?
- Can we infer the counterfactuals, i.e., what is the minimal change to a DNA sequence that turns off the observed effects? Can we also compute the semifactuals?


My name in Mandarin is Kuei-Hsien Chu (朱桂賢). Hsien pronounced like Shane, and that's how I got Shane. I grew up in Taiwan and have been living in the US since 2008.
