I am a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Washington University in St. Louis. My advisor is Gary Stormo. My research interest is developing computational methods for computational biology problems.

A central theme in my research is to consider what representation is suited for DNA sequences that give the most helpful information. Traditionally, there are k-mers, position-weight-matrices, parametric statistical models like HMMs, and, more recently, deep neural network. I am currently interested in sparse representations, a framework that allows us to build techniques to answer challenging inferential questions in regulatory genomics.

For example, in regulatory genomics, we want to infer the following:

- The DNA sequences' regulatory elements, e.g., the motifs.
- The key regulatory elements in the DNA sequences give rise to the observed phenomenon.
- The counterfactuals, e.g., a minimal change to a DNA sequence that turns off the observed effects. 


My name in Mandarin is Kuei-Hsien Chu (朱桂賢). Hsien pronounced like Shane, and that's how I got Shane. I grew up in Taiwan and have been living in the US since 2008.
