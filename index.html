My advisor is Gary Stormo. My research interest is developing computational methods for computational biology problems.</p> <p>A central theme in my research is to consider what representation is suited for DNA sequences that give the most helpful information. Traditionally, there are k-mers, position-weight-matrices, parametric statistical models like HMMs, and, more recently, deep neural network. I am currently interested in sparse representations, a framework that allows us to build techniques to answer challenging inferential questions in regulatory genomics.</p> <p>For example, in regulatory genomics, we want to infer the following:</p> <ul> <li><p>The DNA sequences&#39; regulatory elements, e.g., the motifs.</p> <li><p>The key regulatory elements in the DNA sequences give rise to the observed phenomenon.</p> <li><p>The counterfactuals, e.g., a minimal change to a DNA sequence that turns off the observed effects. </p> </ul> <p>We can obtain a sparse representation of DNA sequences using principled deep learning techniques – one such approach is called deep unfolding. We use <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.06.515322v3">sparse representations from deep unfolding to reveal many more hidden motifs not shown on the JASPAR database</a>. Our result shows that sparse representation is a scalable and interpretable approach to biological sequence problems.</p> <p>My name in Mandarin is Kuei-Hsien Chu &#40;朱桂賢&#41;.
