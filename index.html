My advisor is Gary Stormo. My research interest is developing computational methods for computational biology problems.</p> <p>A central theme in my research is to consider what representation is suited for DNA sequences that give the most helpful information. Traditionally, there are k-mers, position-weight-matrices, parametric statistical models like HMMs, and, more recently, deep learning. I am particularly interested in sparse representations, a framework that allows us to build techniques to answer challenging inference questions in regulatory genomics.</p> <p>For example, these inference questions include:</p> <ul> <li><p>What are the DNA sequences&#39; regulatory elements &#40;e.g., motifs&#41;?</p> <li><p>What key regulatory features in the DNA sequences give rise to the observed phenomenon?</p> <li><p>Can we infer the counterfactuals, i.e., what is the minimal change to a DNA sequence that turns off the observed effects? Can we also compute the semifactuals?</p> </ul> <p>My name in Mandarin is Kuei-Hsien Chu &#40;朱桂賢&#41;. Hsien pronounced like Shane, and that&#39;s how I got Shane. I grew up in Taiwan and have been living in the US since 2008.</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Shane Chu.
